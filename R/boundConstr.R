#' Boundary constraints
#'
#' @description
#' Builds a constraint matrix and bound vectors for constraining the boundary of splines and other nonlinear functions to a given value. This is a generic function designed to be used in the [constr][buildCmat()] formula interface. It allows methods for a wide range of regression terms.
#'
#' @param x An object representing a design matrix of predictor variables, typically basis functions. See Details for supported objects.
#' @param value A numerical indicating the boundary constraint value. Default to 0.
#' @param side Character indicating the side on which the constraint applies. One of `"right"` (the default), `"left"` or `"both"`.
#' @param deg A positive integer indicating the degree of smoothness for the constraint. The default value is different according to the method. See details.
#' @param intercept For the default and factor method, a logical value indicating if the design matrix includes an intercept. In most cases, it will be automatically extracted from `x`, but this argument can be used to override it.
#' @param ... Additional parameters passed to or from other methods. Includes `value` and `deg` for most methods.
#'
#' @details
#' Enforcing boundary constraints amounts to imposing an equality constraint on the `deg` first (if `side = left`), last (if `side = right`), or both (if `side = both`) coefficients of the basis matrix `x`. The equality constraint sets the bounds to `lb = ub = value`.
#'
#' ## Usage
#'
#' The recommended usage is to use this function through a call to `bound` on a term in the [constr][buildCmat()] formula interface. This method is then called internally to create the constraint matrix and bound vectors. However, `boundConstr` can also be called directly on a matrix-like object to manually build or inspect the constraint matrix.
#'
#' All methods internally rely on the default method for general matrices. Unless specified, all methods use the same parameters as the default one, which are passed through `...`. The only exception is `intercept` which is often inferred from the `x` object itself. In a typical usage in which `boundConstr` is called from the `constr` argument, `intercept` is automatically determined from the [glm][stats::glm()] formula.
#'
#' ## The `deg` parameter and spline bases
#'
#' The `deg` parameter indicates the number of coefficients on the left/right that are constrained to be equal to `value` and can be interpreted as a smoothness degree for the boundary constraint. The default is different for each method. It is set to 1 for the default method or the methods related to categorical variables (e.g. `factor` and `strata`).
#'
#' For B-spline bases methods (such as `bs`, `ps` and `ns`), the default is to be equal to the degree of the spline. This corresponds to the number of bases that are non-null at the boundary, are therefore that contribute to the value of the smooth at the boundary. Since, by construction, B-spline basis functions sum to one at any point, constraining all coefficients to `value` will result in the smooth being equal to `value` at the boundary. Note that `deg` can be reduced for `bs` and `ps` (but not `ps`),  resulting in a less smooth convergence towards `value`.
#'
#' ## Available methods
#'
#' In addition to the default method, `boundConstr` currently supports methods for several classes. The full list can also be consulted through `methods(shapeConstr)`.
#'
#' ### Categorical variables
#'
#' * [factor()]: for factors. Extract the [contrasts][stats::contrasts()] to define the constraint matrix. Here the `intercept` argument has the same interpretation as in the default method, i.e. if set to `TRUE` it means the `glm` model does not include an intercept externally to the factor. Note that, in this case, a simple dummy coding is done in R.
#' * [strata][dlnm::strata()]: Indicator variables defining strata from the [dlnm][dlnm::dlnm()] package. Here the shape is applied to the coefficient of strata, considering strata like a categorical variable.
#'
#' ### B-spline bases
#'
#' * [bs][splines::bs()]: B-splines bases from the [splines][splines()] package. Here `deg` is set by default to the `degree` of the basis, but can be reduced for a less smooth constraint.
#' * [ns][splines::ns()]: B-spline bases for natural cubic splines from the [splines][splines()] package. Builds constraints for `bs` that are then adjusted for `ns` specifically.
#' * [ps][dlnm::ps()]: P-spline bases from the [dlnm][dlnm::dlnm()] package. For `ps`, `deg` should not be reduced to a lower value than its degree.
#'
#' ### From the [dlnm][dlnm::dlnm] package
#'
#' * [onebasis][dlnm::onebasis()]: General method for basis functions generated in the package. Internally will call other methods depending on the specified basis.
