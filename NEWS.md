# 0.4.0-4

- New `shapeConstr` method for `strata` from `dlnm`
- Some amendments to the help

# 0.4.0-3

- Slight improvement of the main help page and examples.

# 0.4.0-2

## New features
- On attach message for the package.
- New package overview help page.
- Addition of three datasets
- New examples
- `checkCmat` now contains switches to return the reduced `Cmat` and disable warning when redundant/equality constraints are found.

## Changes
- Some improvement of help pages

# 0.4.0-1

## Changes
- Some changes in internal functions streamlining the building of the constraint matrix and bounds. Should not impact the use apart from the odd error message.
- `checkCmat` now returns reduced `Cmat`/`lb`/`ub`, and better identifies equality constraints.

# 0.4.0

## New features
- New method `shapeConstr` to build constraint matrices for shape-constrained splines. Currently works with classes `ns`, `bs` (from package `splines`), `ps` and `onebasis` (from `dlnm`). Also includes a default method for more general bases.
- New function `zerosumConstr` for constraint matrices for a zero sum such as used in compositional regression for instance.
- New function `edf` to compute observed and expected degrees of freedom for a fitted `cirls` object.
- Method `logLik.cirls` for AIC and BIC computation.
- New function `uncons` to return the unconstrained model.
- Constraints can now be passed as a formula through a new argument called `constr`.
- New function `buildCmat` to build a constraint matrix using a model frame and a list of matrices or constraint formula (or both).

## Changes
- Changed the default QP solver to `quadprog` after some expriments.
- Added the argument `complete` in inferential functions, to allow keeping or discarding aliased coefficients. Same interpretation as in `vcov.lm`.
- `vcov` now allows returning the usual variance-covariance returned by `vcov.glm` when `trunc = FALSE`.
- `simu_coef` renamed as `simulCoef` and now includes an argument to set the seed. 
- `check_cmat` has been renamed `checkCmat`. It also now returns logical vectors instead of vectors of indices
- Now the `Cmat`, `lb` and `ub` used are not returned in the `control` object from the result of `glm` with `cirls.fit`.
- Now `lb` and `ub` can be passed by term.
- The element `aic` of a fitted `cirls` object is penalised by the number of active constraints.

## Bug fixes
- Fixed issue with R matrix when there was less observations than variables.
- Fixed error from `solve.QP` when there are large values in the response.
- Now `checkCmat` also checks if there are "zero" constraints.
- Fixed a bug in `simulCoef`. Now includes a switch to simulate under the constrained or unconstrained model.
- `simulCoef` returns a NA matrix with a warning in the case of a saturated model.

# 0.3.0

## New features
- Added `check_cmat` and `coef_simu` to the list of exported functions as they can be useful for specific use cases.
- Added full documentation.

## Bug fixes
- In `check_cmat`, removed the call to `limSolve::nnls()` to be replaced by `coneproj::coneB` (also a NNLS solver) to reduce the number of dependencies.

# 0.2.1

## New features
- Initialization of a short documentation for several functions.

## Bug fixes
- `cirls.control` now checks for constraint matrix irreducibility.
- `cirls.control` is now exported.
- changed the function to determine redundant constraints in `check_cmat`
- No warning message on row rank of `Cmat` anymore
- `Cmat` is now checked only when there are more than one row

# 0.2.0

## New features
- Method vcov for cirls to compute corrected covariance matrices
- Method confint for cirls to compute feasible confidence intervals
- Added several QP solvers: quadprog (the original one), osqp and coneproj.

## Changes
- A warning is now displayed when Cmat is not of full row rank
- vcov and confint return NA matrices if Cmat is not of full row rank
- Changed residual df computation to account for active constraints
- Replaced bvec by lb (lower bound) and ub (upper bound). Allows equality constraints.
- Added cirls class to glm output

## Bug fixes
- cirls.fit has the same behaviour as glm.fit when model is singular: fill with NAs
